/**
 * Request-body casing for wallet-auth writes.
 *
 * `Fetcher.request` snake_cases every body by default, because most of the API
 * takes snake_case JSON. A handful of endpoints don't — their OpenAPI schemas
 * declare camelCase properties — and for those the default silently corrupts
 * the request. Where the camelCase field is required the call fails outright;
 * where it's optional the server returns 200 and quietly ignores it, which is
 * the worse failure because nothing surfaces.
 *
 * These tests pin the opt-out for the endpoints that need it, and guard against
 * a new camelCase endpoint being added without one.

 * `opensea-js` mirror, where `packages/api-types/` doesn't exist at all and
 * api-types is an ordinary npm dependency. (`opensea-api.json` is in the
 * package's `files`, so it ships.) The monorepo paths stay as a fallback for
